# Oxalis AS4 installation

We will be basing this installation guide on Oxalis _5.0.5_ for Oxalis and _5.0.3_ for Oxalis-AS4. Specifically _Oxalis Server_ ([download](https://search.maven.org/artifact/network.oxalis/oxalis-server/5.0.5/jar)) for inbound traffic and _Oxalis Standalone_ ([download](https://search.maven.org/artifact/network.oxalis/oxalis-standalone/5.0.5/jar)) for outbound traffic. The same approach will work for all the other components of Oxalis 5.x
